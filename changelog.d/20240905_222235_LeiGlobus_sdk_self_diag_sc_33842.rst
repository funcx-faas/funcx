- The Globus Compute self-diagnostic is now available as a stand-alone console
  script installed as part of the globus-compute-sdk package, instead of only
  as the ``self-diagnostic`` sub-command of the globus-compute-endpoint CLI.

  For more information, see ``globus-compute-diagnostic --help``
