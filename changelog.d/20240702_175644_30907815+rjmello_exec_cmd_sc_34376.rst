New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added the ``globus-compute-endpoint python-exec`` command to run Python modules as scripts
  from the Globus Compute endpoint CLI. The primary use case is to launch Parsl processes
  without requiring additional commands in the user's ``PATH`` (e.g., ``process_worker_pool.py``).
